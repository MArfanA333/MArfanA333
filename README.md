## Projects
- **Smart Kitchen Management System (Capstone Project)**: Developed an IoT-based food inventory and meal planning system using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors and a Flutter mobile app. Inclusing Features like Recipe Recommendations, automated shopping lists, and meal planner.
- **Recipe Recommendation System**: Built a Hybrid Recommender using Bayesian Scoring, Jaccard Similarity, TF-IDF, and SVD.
- **Malicious Node Detection**: Used random forest, XGBoost and other methods to find the best model to predict Malicious Sensor Nodes in a IoT environment in R.
- **Phishing URL Detection**: Used logistic Regression and decision trees in Python to detect phishing attempts from URLs with 92.9% accuracy. Also predicted Web Traffic based on the URL and other metrics.
- **Fine-Tuning LLMs for Equivalent Mutant Detection**: Fine-tuned PLBart and UniXCoder to classify equivalent mutants in Finite State Machines (FSMs).
- **Game of Life**: A GUI project using Java to create the game of life
- **Garage Management System**: A Database project using Java and SQL to create a system to store and manage cars' details
